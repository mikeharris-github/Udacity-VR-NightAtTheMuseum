# Udacity_P5_NightAtTheMuseum
This is the 5th and final project for the “core” tracks in the Udacity VR Developer Nanodegree program.
For this project, the student is required to research a topic on a VR company, VR technology, or an industry that could be impacted by VR technology. Once a topic is determined, the student must create a “night at the museum” experience. This consists of a museum-like environment that has multiple information booths which include information on the topic.
