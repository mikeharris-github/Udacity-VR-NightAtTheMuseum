What I liked: I liked that this forced me to explore more into new areas of virtual reality. Before starting the project, I was only fairly knowledgeable about foveated rendering at a high level. This project made me dig deeper and understand more on how it works.
What was challenging: Getting the video to work and creating a unique text UI was probably the most challenging.
